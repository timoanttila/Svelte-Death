# A study of death

I have long been interested in death. When I turned 38 years I've been thinking a lot of what I have achieved and how quickly time goes by.

I am intimidated by the idea that this mighty machine called the body can be shut down like an old computer and thrown away.

I have long wanted to do some research on what it really is death, and whether we have the hope of eternal life or rebirth. Religions offer beautiful words, but are they just a way to get people to believe or is there some reality in them?

I believe that science can make our lives longer in the future, but its time may come too late for me. I’d like to live forever and I’m afraid of being shut down, but luckily I still have decades ahead - hopefully.
